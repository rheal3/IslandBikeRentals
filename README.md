## How It Works
1. The customer creates a booking through the "RENT" button. 
2. Once the personal details are filled out they can click to go the payment screen. Here the customer can then choose to pay the full amount then and there or pay a deposit. 
3. Once the payment details are entered the customer is taken to a booking complete page that shows their reference number and automatically sends them an email with their booking details.
4. After the customer has made a booking the details will show up in the admin's bookings list. The admin can click through each booking to view more details, update, or delete the booking.
